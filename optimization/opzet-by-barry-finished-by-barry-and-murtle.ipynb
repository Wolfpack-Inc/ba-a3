Given a total of 4 teams, at most 8 engines can be maintained regardless of the lenght of the planning horizon.

The results show that engines $56$, $66$, $68$, and $82$ have not been assigned to any team.

As a result engine $82$ only contributes a penalty cost of 9 to the overall costs in [Optimization Task 2 - Part B](#Task-2-Part-B), whereas it contributes a penalty cost of 27 when using the consultancy company's predictions.

Engine $56$ was not assigned in the maintenance schedule for [Optimization Task 2 - Part C](#Task-2-Part-C), but is assigned to a team when the planning horizon is extended to 25 days. While engine $56$ has the highest possible penalty cost per day ($9$), since its RUL is 18 in [Optimization Task 2 - Part C](#Task-2-Part-C) it would only incur penalty costs for two days, which was a more optimal decision than having another engine unmaintained for a longer time. However, in the current scenario there are an additional 5 days were engine $56$ would be unmaintained and thus quickly adding to the total cost given the high penalty costs per day. Hence, it makes sense that engine $56$ now is included in the maintenance schedule whereas it was not included in [Optimization Task 2 - Part C](#Task-2-Part-C). \n",
