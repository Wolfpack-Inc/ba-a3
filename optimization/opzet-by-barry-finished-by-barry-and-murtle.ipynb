We can assume, we are currently at day t = 1 and company X wants to allocate teams to engines in order to minimize penalty costs for a planning horizon T. \n",

    "#### Parameters\n",
    "Based on the given task, we define the following parameters: \n",
    "- The set of engines that needs maintenance is $M = {1,2,...j}$\n",
    "- The planning horizon is $T = {1,2,...,t}$\n",
    "- The available working teams are $G = {1,2,..g}$\n",
    "- The Remaing Useful Time (RUL) for each engine is $RUL_j$ \n",
    "- The number of required working days of team g on engine j is $\\mu_{g,j}$\n",
    "- The daily penalty cost of a engine j is $c_j$ \n",
    "- Let $s_{g,j,t}$ be the saving of costs if team $g$ starts working on engine $j$ from day $t$\n",

Overall, in this scenario (using the consultancy company's predictions) the total penalty costs of the maintenance schedule is 33, whereas our own predictions gave 0 penalty costs.\n",

    "Again, the _max-engine constraint_ has the same effect as seen in [Optimization Task 2 - Part B](#Task-2-Part-B). Both teams of type $A$ and type $B$ can only work on at most 2 engines within a planning horizon. Given a total of 4 teams, at most 8 engines can be maintained regardless of the lenght of the planning horizon. Since there are 12 engines with a RUL $\\leq 20$ in the consultany company's predictions, we know that at least 4 engines will be unmaintained. The results show that engines $56$, $66$, $68$, and $82$ have not been assigned to any team. On top of that, there is one engine (engine $76$) that incurs costs for being partly unmaintained at some point in throughout the planning horizon. Collectively these penalty costs total to 105 for the entire maintenance schedule.\n",

    "Comparing these results to the results from [Optimization Task 2 - Part B](#Task-2-Part-B), they are relatively similar. Out of the 8 engines that are maintained in both scenarios, 7 engines are overlapping: $34, 20, 35, 42, 81, 31, 76$. There are also similarities with regards to the order that engines are maintained between the schedules. For example, both schedules start work on engines $81, 34$ and $76$ on the first day.\n",

    "The most notable differences between the schedules relates to the predicted RUL values. For example, engine $82$ is unmaintained in both maintenance schedules. However, our predicted RUL for engine $82$ is 17, whereas the consultancy company predicts a RUL of 11 for engine $82$. As a result engine $82$ only contributes a penalty cost of 9 to the overall costs in [Optimization Task 2 - Part B](#Task-2-Part-B), whereas it contributes a penalty cost of 27 when using the consultancy company's predictions. Given smaller RUL predictions and more engines within the same planning horizon, it is to be expected that the penalty costs are higher in comparison to [Optimization Task 2 - Part B](#Task-2-Part-B).\n",

    "Due to the increase in time horizon T, it not surpising to see that the total penalty costs in this scenario are much higher in comparison to [Optimization Task 3 - Part C](#Task-3-Part-C). Furthermore, again, the _regional constraints_ limit the maintenance performance of teams 1 and 3 to only engines 20 and 31, which contributes to the substantial increase in total penalty costs compared to [Optimization Task 2 - Part D](#Task-3-Part-D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when we compare the results of the current optimization task to the results of [Optimization Task 3 - Part C](#Task-3-Part-C), we notice a difference in engine assignment. In [Optimization Task 3 - Part C](#Task-3-Part-C), team 4 starts working on engine 76 on day 1 and does not maintain engine 35, whereas in the current task, team 4 starts working on engine 35 on day 1 and does not maintain engine 76. For [Optimization Task 3 - Part C](#Task-3-Part-C), $Q_{35} + P_{4, 76, 1} + P_{4, 49, 7} = 99$ and $Q_{76} + P_{4, 35, 1} + P_{4, 49, 9} = 103$. Hence, it is more cost-efficient to let team 4 perform maintenance on engines 76 and 49 starting at day 1 and 7 respectively. However, for this current optimization task - due to the longer time horizon of $T = 25$ - $Q_{35} + P_{4, 76, 1} + P_{4, 49, 7} = 134$ and $Q_{76} + P_{4, 35, 1} + P_{4, 49, 9} = 128$. Thus, in this task, it is more cost-efficient to let team 4 perform maintenance on engines 35 and 49 starting at day 1 and 9 respectively. The aforementioned reasoning explains the difference in assignment between the previous task [Optimization Task 3 - Part C](#Task-3-Part-C) and the current task.\n",

First off, we noticed that the more constraint the optimization problem, the lower the running time associated with finding an optimal solution.

Furthermore, the constraints increase the total costs of the schedule by limiting the availability of the teams. \n",
